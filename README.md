## This software is not complete and is currently missing major features
It is not recommended to use unless you want to give feedback this early but if you want to actively use the software please wait until an official release.

### Environment
v0lture stats has been built and tested using PHP `7.0` and `7.1`, these are the only two versions we will be supporting with this software.

### Developing
A `secrets.template` file should be renamed `secrets.php` and set all of your environment variables in order to use on your own deployment.
